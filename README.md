# GET THE OUTPUT FILE!

You don't have to do such as what I've done in the video, you can just copy the content of [output.lua](https://github.com/flamendless/LOVE-API-Extractor-for-ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/output.lua) and then paste it in `ZeroBraneStudio/spec/lua.lua`, near the end of the file.
